## Prerequisites

Before moving on, make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine: 

* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed, neither simply [brew it!](https://brew.sh)

* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Then verify that you are running **node v4.x.x** or higher and **npm 3.x.x** or higher by running the commands `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.

* Angular-cli - You're going to use the Angular cli to build the front-end. Make sure you've installed Node.js first and then install angular cli globally using `npm install -g @angular/cli`.



### Usage

Also you can run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.


### Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma].

#### Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor].
