## Prerequisites

Before moving on, make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine: 

* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed, or simply [brew it!](https://brew.sh)

* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Then verify that you are running **node v4.x.x** or higher and **npm 3.x.x** or higher by running the commands `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.

* Angular-cli - You're going to use the Angular cli to build the front-end. Make sure you've installed Node.js first and then install angular cli globally using `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
